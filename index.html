				<p> I actually started coding and didn’t know I was coding with my good ole Myspace page. Fast forward several years, I went to school for graphic design, took several courses in web design, procured my design degree, but those courses gave me the coding bug. After COVID, I decided to take the leap and fully immerse myself in web development. 
				</p>
				
				<p>I have an odd talent for guessing people’s age, within a one plus or minus range.

						Guess Word is a word guessing game that requires players to guess letters, correctly or incorrectly, before they use their allotted guesses in order to win. This project uses vanilla Javascript to check the user’s input and match it with the correct word. The guessed words are fetched from a text file and used randomly.

						The Name Tag Generator displays any name that a user adds. The name tags are created using JSX and stateful components. Lifecycle methods, mounting, unmounting, and updating, are also used to save a name tag once the screen is refreshed or closed then opened.
